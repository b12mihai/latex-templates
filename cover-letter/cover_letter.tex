\opening{Dear Mr. Johnson,}

\vspace{1.5cm}
I found your job posting in the New Orleans Chronicle Star last Monday. I am a freelance hardware engineer with experience in computer and network debugging, very similar to what the job posting asks for.

In addition to reading the enclosed resume, please take a look at my projects at \url{http://www.samplemihaiprojects.com}. 

My schedule typically allows for about 25 hours of freelance work per week.
 I would be delighted if that could be consumed with support and service from Amber Press.

Thank you for responding to my application.
